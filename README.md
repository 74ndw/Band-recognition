# Band recognition
This code was written for the final assignment of the course: Audio Processing and Indexing. Our goal for this assignment was to implement an algorithm for band classification. This is a task where a part of a song is given and the band that made that song has to be found. This can be useful when a user likes a song and wants to find more from the same creator. A similar task called genre classification is done more. As the name suggests this task focuses on recognizing which genre a piece of a song is.

# Dataset
The used dataset is self-procured, containing 100+ songs from the following bands/composers: Mozart, Gucci, Bob Dylan, Abba, The Beatles, Queen, Led Zeppelin, The Rolling Stones, and U2. Due to size limitations this dataset is unavailable to be hosted.

# Measurements
All obtained measurements are available in the measurements directory. The analysis for these measurements can be found in the paper.
